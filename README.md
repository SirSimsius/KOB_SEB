# KOB_SEB

Dear reader, 

The provided codes have to be run sequentially. 

First, the python code for the calculation of SEB components must be run. This requires an account for Google Earth Engine. In the initialization process, a token will be demanded. Please insert the token and complete the authentification. If necessary, change the working directory. Running this code requires input data provided in the excel sheet 'input' in the same working directory. This code will create and export datatables for the whole case area dataset and the subset in csv format, that will be used in the folling analysis in R. 

After creation of the datatables, the R code including data aggregation, statistical analysis and data visualization can be run.

If questions appear or the code is not working, do not hesitate to contact me via the university email address. 

Kind regards, 
Simon Kleiner
